1. Managing a Fitness Center Database
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to develop a Flask application to manage a fitness center's database, focusing on interacting with the Members and WorkoutSessionstables. This will enhance your skills in building RESTful APIs using Flask, handling database operations, and implementing CRUD functionalities.

Task 1: Setting Up the Flask Environment and Database Connection - Create a new Flask project and set up a virtual environment. - Install necessary packages like Flask, Flask-Marshmallow, and MySQL connector. - Establish a connection to your MySQL database. - Use the Members and WorkoutSessions tables used on previous Lessons

Expected Outcome: A Flask project with a connected database and the required tables created.

Task 2: Implementing CRUD Operations for Members - Create Flask routes to add, retrieve, update, and delete members from the Memberstable. - Use appropriate HTTP methods: POST for adding, GET for retrieving, PUT for updating, and DELETE for deleting members. - Ensure to handle any errors and return appropriate responses.

Expected Outcome: Functional endpoints for managing members in the database with proper error handling.

Code Example:

@app.route('/members', methods=['POST'])
def add_member():
    # Logic to add a member
    pass

@app.route('/members/<int:id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_member(id):
    # Logic to retrieve a member
    pass

# other routes to update and delete
NOTE: Make sure you have ALL of the CRUD operations implemented, not just the two above.

Task 3: Managing Workout Sessions - Develop routes to schedule, update, and view workout sessions. - Implement a route to retrieve all workout sessions for a specific member.

Expected Outcome: A comprehensive set of endpoints for scheduling and viewing workout sessions, with the ability to retrieve detailed information about each session.
